Client-side scripts are used extensively by modern web applications.
They perform both simple functions (such as the formatting of text) up to full
manipulation of client side data and operating system interaction.

Unlike traditional Cross Site Scripting (XSS), where the client is able to inject
scripts into a request and have the server return the script to the client, DOM
XSS does not require that a request be sent to the server and may be abused entirely
within the loaded page.

This occurs when elements of the DOM (known as the sources) are able to be
manipulated to contain untrusted data.
The client-side scripts (known as the sinks) in the affected page use or execute
the untrusted data in an unsafe way.

A common attack used by cyber-criminals is to steal a clientâ€™s session token by
injecting JavaScript, however DOM XSS vulnerabilities can also be abused to exploit
clients.

Arachni has discovered that it is possible to insert script content directly into
HTML event. For example `<div onmouseover="x=INJECTION_HERE"</div>` where
`INJECTION_HERE` represents the location where the Arachni payload was detected.

To remedy XSS vulnerabilities, it is important to never use untrusted or unfiltered
data within the code of a HTML page.

Untrusted data can originate not only form the client but potentially a third
party or previously uploaded file etc.

Filtering of untrusted data typically involves converting special characters to
their HTML entity encoding equivalent (however, other methods do exist, see references).
These special characters include:

* `&`
* `<`
* `>`
* `"`
* `'`
* `/`

An example of HTML entity encoding is converting a `<` to `&lt;`.

Although it is possible to filter untrusted input, there are five locations
within a HTML page where untrusted input (even if it has been filtered) should
never be placed:

1. Directly in a script.
2. Inside an HTML comment.
3. In an attribute name.
4. In a tag name.
5. Directly in CSS.

Each of these locations have their own form of escaping and filtering.

_Because many browsers attempt to implement XSS protection, any manual verification
of this finding should be conducted utilising multiple different browsers and
browser versions._
